## Description
Internet Radio client which was designed all around [Dirble API](https://dirble.com/developer/api).

User can easily navigate between main radio station categories grouped by music genre. 

For specific station user can start playback and continue listening to it while app in background.

User also has an access to additional meta data like station bitrate and song history.

## Song history
At the moment app doesn't provide any real time updates of song history. It simply consumes items from API 
and display them as it is.
